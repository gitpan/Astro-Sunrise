    - I've moved the POD around and added a function documentation block for
      the sunrise() function. And I moved all the variables out of the use
      vars block at the top, making them my variables, wherever possible.
      I added a small test suite that leaves a lot of room for future expansion.

      Finally, I moved all of those tiny subs out of the sunrise() function
      into their own space. They are not really private subs, and they are
      referencing values as global variables anyway. Oh, yeah, and I generated
      the README with pod2text so that the README on CPAN will be a little
      more informative. R.Bowen
