NAME
    Astro::Sunrise - Perl extension for computing the sunrise/sunset on a given day

SYNOPSIS
      use Astro::Sunrise;
      
      ($sunrise, $sunset) = sunrise(YYYY,MM,DD,longitude,latitude,Time Zone,DST);

DESCRIPTION
  
   This module will return the sunrise/sunset for a given day. 
   
   Eastern longitude is entered as a positive number
   Western longitude is entered as a negative number
   Northern latitude is entered as a positive number
   Southern latitude is entered as a negative number
       There are a number of altitides to chose from, I have chosen
       -0.833 because this is what most countries use. Feel free to 
       change it if you need to. Here is the list:
       h = 0 degrees: Center of Sun's disk touches a mathematical horizon
       h = -0.25 degrees: Sun's upper limb touches a mathematical horizon
       h = -0.583 degrees: Center of Sun's disk touches the horizon; atmospheric refraction accounted for
       h = -0.833 degrees: Sun's supper limb touches the horizon; atmospheric refraction accounted for
       h = -6 degrees: Civil twilight (one can no longer read outside without artificial illumination)
       h = -12 degrees: Nautical twilight (navigation using a sea horizon no longer possible)
       h = -15 degrees: Amateur astronomical twilight (the sky is dark enough for most astronomical observations)
       h = -18 degrees: Astronomical twilight (the sky is completely dark)

  sunrise

        ($sunrise, $sunset) = sunrise(YYYY,MM,DD,longitude,latitude,Time Zone,DST);
        ($sunrise, $sunset) = sunrise( 2001, 3, 10, 17.384, 98.625, -5, 0 );

    Returns the sunrise and sunset times, in HH:MM format. (Note: Time Zone is the offset from GMT and DST is daylight
    savings time, 1 means DST is in effect and 0 is not.
